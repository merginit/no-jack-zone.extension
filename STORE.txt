NoJack Zone - Stop Keyboard Hijacking

NoJack Zone prevents websites from hijacking your browser's keyboard shortcuts.
This anti-jackware extension protects essential shortcuts like Ctrl+F, Alt+Left, and Ctrl+C from being overridden by sites.
When a site attempts to hijack your shortcuts, NoJack Zone automatically re-jacks control back to you, ensuring your browser functions exactly as intended.

Stop keyboard hijacking. Stop shortcut stealing. Stop jackware.

What's included:

● Protection for 20+ essential browser shortcuts (Find, Reload, DevTools, etc.)
● Guarding of core editing commands (Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo)
● Prevention of navigation hijacking (Back/Forward buttons)
● Per-domain whitelist for trusted sites
● Granular control to toggle specific shortcuts
● Real-time statistics of prevented hijacking attempts

How it works:

1. Intercepts keyboard events at the window level using high-priority capture phase
2. Overrides preventDefault and propagation methods when protected shortcuts are detected
3. Monitors website attempts to block browser functionality and automatically re-jacks control
4. Restores original event behavior in the next tick to ensure smooth browser operation

Protected against:

● Keyboard shortcut hijacking (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+T, F5, F12)
● Clipboard hijacking (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+X)
● Navigation hijacking (Alt+Left, Alt+Right)
● Developer tools blocking (Ctrl+Shift+I, F12)
● Find-in-page blocking (Ctrl+F)
● Page reload prevention (Ctrl+R, F5)

Perfect for:

✓ Power users who rely on keyboard shortcuts
✓ Developers who need guaranteed DevTools access
✓ Anyone frustrated by sites that block Ctrl+F or copy/paste
✓ Users who value browser control over website interference
